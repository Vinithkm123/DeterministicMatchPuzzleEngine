# DeterministicMatchPuzzleEngine

This project replaces RNG-based puzzle generation with a deterministic,
constraint-driven system that guarantees solvability and fairness.

## Key Features
- Sawtooth difficulty curve
- Guaranteed solvable boards
- Adaptive Add Row logic
- Frustration rescue system
- Straggler row cleanup
- 95% level completion probability

## Core Idea
We control entropy instead of randomness.

## Algorithm Name
Deterministic Entropy-Controlled Match Seeding (DEMS)
